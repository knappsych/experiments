#Overlapping regions of inhibition of return

This project was meant to determine whether there is a
single zone of inhibition in an inhibition of return
experiment using 5 locations and two cues at non-adjacent
locations. If a single zone of inhibition is being used,
there should be equivalent inhibition at the location
between the non-adjacent cued locations. If multiple
zones of inhibition are initiated by attentional
mechanisms, that location should be more inhibited than
the other uncued locations but less inhibited than the
cued locations.
